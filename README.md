Designed a Parking Lot System (Backend) utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB

Tracking available parking spaces in a vast parking area can be challenging. To address this, a parking lot system was developed to monitor available slots, assign parking spaces, and keep track of vehicles' locations. This system aids individuals in locating their parked vehicles in case they forget their parking spot, enhancing the overall parking management efficiency.
